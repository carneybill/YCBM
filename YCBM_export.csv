 I do...Thanks for reaching out.  Different problem at RStudio though.  We have plenty of top of the funnel folks we think 300K visits monthly and 6k downloads. What we need is middle of funnel conversions.  I'd like to talk anyway but the budget is a pittance to what Ive had in the past.  Anytime this week? 
  
 Thanks

 Hi Bill – not sure if you remember me from your Tibco days, but I believe we swapped emails back and forth on different IDG lead gen and marketing programs.    Anyway, attached is a menu-style doc I put together that runs through what else IDG offers.  Take a skim and let me know if there is anything else we can help with.

 I am a graduate student at the University of Chicago. I am an avid R user and teach a class on R requiring Rstudio to the undergraduates here. I have been using Rstudio server edition for a year or two now for my research.   
  
 Some new data I will be working with for my thesis has more stringent security requirements, so if I want to continue using Rstudio I will most likely need to disable the export command -- an option that is only available through Rstudio server pro. So, I was hoping to talk to a sales representative about the possibility of purchasing a pro license. 
  
 Admittedly, I will not be able to afford the price listed the website, which is more than a third of my annual stipend. Hopefully I am not wasting your time. 
  
 My phone number is 773.633.8483. 
  
 Thanks, 
 John Eric",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 I'm an Associate Professor at Victoria University in Wellington New Zealand.  
  
 I'm not sure if there is a product for me? Basically I have a medium-large data set, which I work on mostly alone or with a postdoc.  My work is computationally intensive, and also RAM intensive.  I'm keen to use the Server Pro, but have no means of paying 10k p.a.   
  
 Do you have any intermediate products for people who have needs similar to mine?  
  
 Thanks,

  I have a client who's creating some code in the R package and want to migrate that to R-Studio and needed some help. 
  
 I wanted to understand , if there is some sort of partnership possible to do this? 
  
 This is a part of a larger solution , that is being developed, we are already in contract with the customer to do the rest of the work, however we needed some help on the Shyni app part. We have no experts on the project who can help.. 
  
 I'm looking for some commercial and technical solutions.

 I work in the Ontario Government Information Technology Headquarters, Toronto, Canada. I have discovered only small pockets of RStudio users in a few of our ministries. I suspect it's a very small number. However, having said that the potential adoption would be huge if the potential benefits were socialized within our organization over time.  
  
 I would like to propose adopting Shiny.io  as a test and development initiative within our own (very small) branch. However, we would need to have authentication to comply with government IT security policies. From what I understand, this feature is only available starting with the Basic Shiny.io offering, and quite honestly I can tell you that the monthly hosting fee of $100 / month   makes it impossible for me to put this idea forward as a business case in our very small department.  
  
 We would only need  to have 3 registered web users (1 manager +  2 department members)for the first year I would imagine. This would give my manager an opportunity to see what it could do for us in an evaluation phase only.  
  
 Given the hypothetical use case I have described, do you think RStudio could possible offer a basic, scaled-down version with authentication at no cost for an agreed upon evaluation period? I think the product is amazing myself  and would even be tempted to pay what I could afford out of my own pocket if it provided a path to illustrate the possibilities to our management. 
  
 Hope I have provided enough background to make our meeting beneficial . 
  
 Thank you and I look forward to talking with you on Mar 15. 
  
 Cheers,

 I have been tasked with recommending a BI solution for an EU Agency. I have used SAS in my previous job, but have heard great things about R. The low cost, easy administration, user community/analytics packages, and interactive graphics is what draws me to R. 
  
 I have a few questions about R relating to interactive applications and supporting R in a server environment for 20 users.

 Three main topics we would like to discuss:  
 - In AWS we want to use dynamic upscaling of servers. Do you have license models for that?  
 - We want to turn-off the R studio in the cloud during the nighttime, is that possible or do we constantly have to re-activate the license if we do that?  
 - How does your licence handle non-production environments for testing purposes?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manager / Executive,10,,,

I've have a few clients on opensource using our app. I'm a rags to riches story, I taught myself R, then shiny, AWS, MySQL... all in the last 1.5 years now supporting team of 4. 
  
 Several technical questions: 
 1. How many cores do I need. I want to have 150 people at a conference follow along in the app. If one step takes 3 seconds, I dont want someone waiting 450 seconds 
  
 2. Some of my users are complaining about random grey outs. I've been able to simulate my switching my laptop from by wireless wifi to my iphones hot spot. Is there a way to prevent this. 
  
 3. I also was trying to compare to AWS using Elastic Load Balancer, Joe Cheng even replied to a post in google groups saying you could do that using open source. I haven't done the math but if I got 10 servers, plus load balancer seemed like it would come to ~200/month so a better deal, but if those servers needed to be multi core not small instances serverpro would win if I only needed one lisence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Developer / Engineer,1,,,

 Few analysts in our company would be interested in exploring the capabilities of your software, especially the Shiny-components. Before we start anything new we should understand a bit more your licensing policy and trial offerings. Another thing I would like to ask is the payment method options as credit card payment is not supported when it comes to licens purchases.

I've also been building a Customer Lifetime Value model in R with a statistician on our BI team (using the {BTYD} package). This has been great experience and allowed us to start doing some serious predictive modelling. Although the package allows us to estimate models that we might not be able to use otherwise, it requires significant RAM to iterate over numerous cohorts of customers in our database. I started running this R code using the {BTYD} package on my local machine, then moved it to a remote desktop to get more RAM, but still had to upgrade the RAM on this machine to 16Gb in order for the code to run without getting memory errors. This has made it clear to our leadership team that we need to find a longer-term solution to running more advanced  statistical and machine learning methods in R.  
  
 In terms of the analytics team at Clearly - I am the Senior Analyst, focused on web analytics. I have an intern who started about 4 months ago, but will be joining the team full-time after her internship is over. We also have a Senior Analyst on our BI team who primarily uses SPSS for building models, and a Data Analyst Lead on the BI team who mostly uses SQL and Excel. They are all starting out in R, but I'm hoping that they will become power users of R as well. 
  
 I'd like to discuss RStudio Server Pro and what it can offer. In particular: 
 -Pricing 
 -Scaling compute and RAM to meet the demands of the team 
 -Enterprise-level support for R 
 -Improving productivity in R 
 -Collaborating on projects in R 
 -Using git in RStudio 
 -Security of our data 
 -Publishing R Markdown reports and Shiny Apps that execs and business users can access

 We are a healthcare technology startup located in NYC, and we are interested in understanding the Shiny Server Pro solution for our data visualization and data analytics app prototyping. 
  
 Due to our healthcare data, we are looking for a solution that would allow us to host Shiny Applications on our own AWS instances, but wanted to inquire on two specific points: 
  
 1) We are obligated to follow HIPAA regulations as a result of our work with PHI. Can you share if Shiny Server Pro is HIPAA compliant? Would we be able to enter into a HIPAA BAA with RStudio? 
  
 2) We need to have the ability to log the interactions that a user has with a Shiny application. We are familiar with Shiny's ability to log reactive elements, but wanted to understand if every action that is taken by a user (e.g. clicking on ""Next Page"" to view more records in a data table) can be logged for our contractual obligations. 
  
 Looking forward to discussing further, please give me a call at 845-596-1424 if you would like to touch base prior to the sales appointment. 
  
 Sincerely, 
 Byran",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data Scientist / Analyst / Statistician,3 to 5,,,

 I write to request permission to stream the free RStudio personal licences to our campus networked classroom computers using Software2's secure eDistribution platform. At the Nottingham Trent University we would like to enhance our students computing experience by offering them a software on demand service for all our educational licenses. This new technology allows software to be streamed to our targeted end users on a demand basis and all end user licensing restrictions are still observed. For more information on this method of software delivery please see http://www.software2.co.uk/ 
 This new software delivery technology will not have any effect on your product but we would like to have your permission to use this technology on your product.  
  
 Should you have any questions or concerns relating to this matter then please do not hesitate to contact me. We have used the Application Jukebox product for streaming applications to desktops for a year and this deployment technology has been very successful. Please advise if this is not possible under current licensing terms and conditions or whether other special arrangements are required. 
  
 Kind regards 
 Winston",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IT / Database Professional,50ish,,,

 All of them are banks in TW and HK. But banks always need some solution partner who can help them solve all problem them meet locally or in person.   
  
 So they need some solution partner or certificated partner of RStudio in TW who could help them when they meet problem. I know RStudio already provided online supporting service, but it's not enough for banks.  
  
 Our team has a very strong background in R. Most of our team members are belong to Taiwan R User Group.

 I'm a French Consultant working for an IT company. 
  
 For a project, I would like to discuse with you about a shinyapps.io subsription. 
 I'm interested with the Standard Plan but you would like to have more informations on performance and security (i have already read your articles). 
  
 Security : 
 Inside an Rshiny application, can I hide some objects for specific user (basic users and advanced users) ? And how can I put it into practice ? 
  
 Performance: 
 Does each Application instance has 8 Go RAM ? 
 I have an application how needs 10 Go RAM, how can I deal with this ? 
  
 Regards,

 2. I have seen that Shiny Server Pro comes with authentication built in. However, we are still very concerned about how much work it will be to set up a secure database environment. Do you have detailed guidelines about this?

This went well, so we need to move to the next stage to see about pricing. 
  
 We need to develop an application, and then deploy it on 3-4 servers (as well as keep our capability for development). There would be 2 developers at or site and 2 at the customer site.  
  
 It’s the Rstudio (pro) that we need in multiple copies for the “developers”  and us. For the server we need only one in our opinion 
 I understand the connect is so you can upload R scripts to their cloud (but OK I may be wrong, it is a module loaded into R) 
 I think Shiny server pro is again 1x and we need to find out if that’s in addition to server pro (probably, since it’s an add-on) 
 apps.io? why? it’s a cloud product. 
  
 What we have is (say) 4 or 5 developers, and (say) 30 users of ONE server. 
 The developers need an RStudio pro with shiny, using (from what I see) rconnect 
 The server needs to be shiny. 
 From what we see, the server manages a login so both users and developers have a login.  
 You just navigate to a page with a conventional web browser, and of course it checks your login. 
 It’s probably here that the license constrain is applied so if you licensed 30 users it will not let you exceed that. 
  
 No external publication capability (no publication to Rstudio’s externally hosted cloud)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Developer / Engineer,0,,,

 I am a system trader.  
 RStudio connect is exactly what I was looking for. 
 So I want to use it in our business. 
  
 But, over  $14000/year is too expensive for us considering our budget. 
 There are only 3 members in our team and 2 persons are using RStudio. 
  
 So, I'd like to know you can give us a price deal.

 I'm leading a startup and am serious about moving ahead and purchasing a subscription to shinyapps, likely the standard option. Also, I'm the lead developer, so hopefully this conversation will be useful.  I have a few particular questions that I'm hoping to get answers to tomorrow, mostly about user authentication, including: 
 --How do usernames get passed as environment variables to the Shiny session? 
 --In the registration page, can we have a custom terms and services of using the app? 
 --Do we have the ability to remove usernames as we see fit?

 I'm currently contracted as a data analyst to a major client, and my specialization is in reporting. While I'm an expert in R programming, I've only recently become familiar with Shiny.  
  
 My customer would have a great appreciation for a product that can take a CSV, apply the automated performance metrics on that data from scripts that we've created, and have Shiny pages that are available for display / evaluation 24/7.  
  
 My goal is to determine what my options might be in terms of Shiny integration. I'm not specifically looking at Shiny Server Pro or at Shiny apps, but at our goal to decrease the time / effort given to reviewing evaluation metrics. 
  
 I'd like to review my options, and I greatly appreciate your time and assistance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Data Scientist / Analyst / Statistician,1000+,,,

These dashboards will pull data from sql servers on the clients premises.  
 As I have the first one of these dashboards ready, I would like to purchase one of the solutions you offer.  
 However, Im not sure which is the best solution for me.  
  
 What I need is the following: 
 - the app pulls data from sql (or any other database) which is located on the clients premises. I currently use RODBC to run this locally, on the clients site. 
 - the app should run quite fast. Any time the app is opened, the sql query will be executed, so I can imagine that for some configurations this takes a while. 
 - make the app available on the web with user authentication (this is the case with all paid plans I see) 
  
 I am not sure whether I should: 
 - purchase shinyapps.io professional 
 - purchase shiny server pro and host apps for all my clients from my own server 
 - install shiny server on my clients premises and make this accessible somehow 
 - purchase RStudio connect??

 Would like to shorten the learning curve and make more robust the process of deploying apps/documents, with baked in version/package dependency management. 
  
 Also, the main users/developers of R are business users (data scientists, analysts, etc), and we would like to transfer as much of the dev ops, sys admin responsibilities to the IT department in order for them to focus more on just the analytics portion.   It would be good to get an understanding of how system administrators, with no R knowledge, could help manage the system. 
  
 We have played around a little but with the beta server that is open to the public, but it would be great to get a live demo so we can get a better understanding of all the capabilities. 
  
 Also, based on our research we have several specific questions: 
  
 •	How easily can the downtime of the server be managed by people with no R experience (i.e. system admins) 
 •	Is there ability to roll back versions of applications or documents? 
 •	Ability to organize apps/documents in folders? 
 •	Ability to schedule reports via trigger (i.e. touch a file)? 
 a.	Or via api call 
 •	More custom scheduling options? 
 a.	Weekends? 
 b.	Multiple schedules, i.e. run every minute, email every day 
 c.	Can the scheduler save copies with datestamp? 
 •	Performance of applications compared to open source Shiny Server? 
 •	Ability to load balance across multiple nodes? 
  
  
 Look forward to chatting with you.

 1. Do we have to purchase licenses for Dev and Test environments as well or just Production? 
  
 2. Is R Shiny licensed separately or included in the R Studio Pro license. 
  
 Based on the answers, it will be a 10K per year versus a 60K per year decision, to be made by the project team and we need to make a go/no-go decision soon.

 We're considering a new reporting & dashboarding pipeline. Our existing process includes a lot of R so RStudio Connect seems like an obvious candidate. 
  
 On this call I'd like to get an overview of the product framework, support process, account management structure, how the on-boarding and deploy process is managed, what the typical timelines are, how any future updates, upgrades, and purchases (more seats) are managed, etc etc.  
  
 I anticipate that one Data Analyst in my team and a couple of people from our Program Management group will also attend & they will agree next steps during the call. 
  
 I'm quite familiar with the product already (I've followed its development and saw it demoed at EARL London last year) so the functionality interests me less - but it would be useful to have a quick overview of five or ten minutes for the other attendees.  
  
 I'd consider extending the meeting to 1 hour to accommodate more of this content if you think it useful to show off any new features since I last saw it. 
  
 Thanks, 
 Mike",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manager / Executive,20,,,

We may now be in a position to scale this, but need more information/options. In particular we would like to know whether the license covers individual users or concurrent users and whether using Active Directory/LDAP will have an effect on licensing. The fundamental issue is that we will need only a limited number of concurrent users, but if we open up the server to all staff, this will have serious implications for the number of licenses required (my guess is up to a thousand users) for the shiny server. 
  
 just before purchasing the shiny license one of you suggested to look also at the r publishing platform: would it be possible to get a temporary license to test the system again? with the original one we did not manage to run shiny apps, but we have not put enough time in the testing, so this would actually help us greatly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Manager / Executive,unknown,,,

 I am responsible for the introduction of R-Server, and Shiny Pro respectively, within Siemens Financial Services. 
 I think you were in contact with Andreas Herkert before. As far as I know, he asked you to extend our trial license once. As our supplier, where we placed the order for Shiny Pro about one month ago, still did not deliver, I wanted to ask, whether another extension would be possible for the time being.

I'm therefore interested in understanding what you can do with open source (we're a very young company and don't have much spare cash!) and what requires a non-AGPL licence. For example, the shinyapps.io Standard Package looks like it could be a good option for us. Look forward to discussing further!

 I am only initiating the dialogue to enable my procurement team to take over from there. It will be great if you respond to these questions before the meeting.

We are an independent direct marketing agency and have been using Shiny to develop some dashboards for clients. I want to understand pricing for shiny server pro so that I can deploy shiny on my own server. We are a small organisation with revenues of USD2.5million. I read that shiny offers better pricing for small and medium enterprises. Would be much grateful since the current price is quite high for me.

 Rstudio development for a range of exams, psychometric analyses using various packages, and feedback to examinees using GGplot and interactive Rmarkdown docs using ggiraph and shiny - and examiners. Currently using boxplots and interactive graphs to show exam sections where they are weakest. 
  
 Want to develop dashboards for examinees to check their results, track their performance over time. Drop down widgets takes them to various exams, tabs to visualise their performance on compare themselves to past performance, and cohorts past and present, highlight areas for improvement. 
  
 Need: A secure cloud for the dashboards. The ability for examinees to log in and access their own dashboard. Examiners to log in, and access the dashboard. Examiner dashboards have interactivity much like shiny with selectinput choices that parses information to the server to update what is on screen, and also a dataset for each examiner to record changes to the exam. 
  
 Also need, code support for the development of dashboards, advice and guidance ++

There is great interest from IT and data science to have a means of hosting RShiny apps on servers that are 'owned' by my department (rather than the corp IT RShiny server maintained by Mike Maloney). The existing RShiny server that Liberty has is insufficient because the corp IT team has not addressed the security, environment, and support issues that my group needs addressed before we can use RShiny in production. Ideally we would have on-prem servers (DEV/SIT/UAT/PRD) hosting RShiny apps and providing R algorithms as a service to other via restful api.

R Studio is working well for our classes. Couple of issues to discuss:  
  
 RStudio as a service. I'm not a Linux Admin, and right now I have R Server in an Azure Ubuntu instance.  Would love to offload that task! 
  
 RODBC. I talked to Hadley about a year ago regarding the RODBC package when I was at JP Morgan. He hinted that you guys were looking at upgrading SQL connectivity. If you're going that direction, we would be happy to be a beta site! 
  
 We need to start exposing some students to spark (lyr), and markdown, plotly... what would be the best ""low maintenance, low cost"" approach? 
  
 Thanks!

 I am developing an analytical web app through RStudio and planning to deploy it using Shinyapps.io 
  
 During the prototype phase this will be open-source, but I am thinking of commercialising this as a service in the future. 
  
 I've seen Shinyapps.io license is not AGPL, but am wondering if getting Standard or Professional subscription would be enough to allow me to legally deploy and sell subscriptions to my web app. 
  
 I would like to schedule a call to discuss this further.

 I don’t believe that we received a response for this.  The timeline where we are entitled to use both Shiny Server and Connect is starting to get tighter, and we need to start making decisions about the Connect deployment.   
  
 I would request that we setup a phone call to discuss.  Maybe there are some options here that are not immediately clear.

 Hello Phil, 
  
 As you may remember, we have been investigating the use of Proxied Authentication within Shiny Connect so that we can tie the application to our RACF directory via SAML as opposed to LDAP.  This will enable us to publish dealer facing reports. 
  
 We found in Connect documentation that groups are not supported when using Proxied Authentication: 
 http://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/authentication.html#groups-1 
  
 This creates a pretty serious gap in this solution from a compliance standpoint:  We need to be able to tie access to resources back to groups in one of our internal directories. 
  
 Are there any concrete plans to add support for groups when using Proxied Auth?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 our analysts have developed a benchmarking tool to support English schools in their workforce planning and deployment decisions. The tool is built on RShiny and, to make it available to schools, we want to publish it online, ideally using the ShinyApps.io platform. I would like to set up a telephone conversation between your sales dept and our commercial team to discuss the process that we can follow to be able to do that.  
 I'd be grateful if you could either call me back or let me know when it'd be good to have this conversation. As I need to find a slot for several colleagues, it'd be better to have several slots.  
 We are under some time pressure to deliver this tool, so grateful if we could have this conversation asap.  
  
 Many thanks,

 I use git to manage versions of .Rmd, .R and other src files. My data files are generally too large to store in git, say .5 - 3 GB. My projects involve ""data analysis"" / ""modeling"" that progresses in a daisy chain as I clean up the data and then into a multi branch tree as I try different approaches. The datafiles and src files are linked logically (in the sense   the src files ""transform"" the datafiles).  
  
 I have to believe that this is a common enough set of circumstances and thus I'm honestly surprised that there aren't more tools/packages available to somehow ""stamping"" and ""versioning"" data files. For example, if I look at a datafile, can I tell what script created it and when?  
  
 I do some of this now but it is ad hox and hacky because I wrote it. Essentially I use rstudioapi to get name of file and attach that either as an attribute or in a text file as a data dictionary. 
  
 It will do but isn't there a better way - there are just so many clever people using R I keep thinking I must be reinventing the wheel.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 * Let's say I source a script.  It will give me an error message when it hits an error, but it won't tell me what line of the file the error happened on.  Is there a way to get R or Rstudio to tell me the line or pause where the error happened? 
  
 * Let's say I have a 10-pipe dplyr expression with an error in line 7.  How do I efficiently find this?  Right now, I do lots of text selection and copy/pasting and it's really inefficient and drives me crazy. 
  
 * I haven't fully mastered the Rstudio debugger.  Especially, how do I get it to stop when it hits an error (or warning?)  I get confused about when I need to use debugSource 
  
 * How do I efficiently debug Rmarkdown documents.  This winds up being a lot more inefficient for me with all the ""run chunk"" commands then just sourcing the script.

 We want to implement a live and dev environment for RStudio Server. Currently we only have one server, located at http://rstudio.coastalcontacts.com:8787/, with multiple user accounts. It would be great if we could set up a dev and live version so that we could do development on the dev environment and then run all of our automated R scripts on the live environment. Ideally, the live environment would have only one folder structure, while the dev environment might differ depending on our user accounts.

We are thinking of RStudio farm extension for relatively rare but heavy load bursts that occur in our systems once a week or two.  In order to ensure seamless experience while optimizing resource consumption it would be best to have a cold storage of a couple of additional RStudio server VMs. These machines then can automatically spin up by a script when load burst occur and load balancer will put new users to newly started machines. When load burst finishes, script will shut down the extension VM(s). The problem we are facing is that according to your pricing scheme, we will have to buy a full license while utilizing it 5% of a time, thus wasting nearly 9500$ per sleeping server.

When load burst finishes, script will shut down the extension VM(s). The problem we are facing is that according to your pricing scheme, we will have to buy a full license while utilizing it 5% of a time, thus wasting nearly 9500$ per sleeping server.

 - A secure way of accepting user input (I read that using the eval function is insecure). 
 - If you will help me set up the website (I read through your tutorials and I do not think I can be able to do that on my own) 
 - and more 
  
 - Do you allow use of whatsapp chat. I find that convenient.  Or facebook chat. For me they are best platforms to keep record of the conversations so that I can always turn back to them for reference / reminder

 We have a user that maybe want to use RStudio. She has installed your freeware version and testet RStudio. But as far as i can see, this version is only running per user installation. If i install it on our test environment, regular users are not able to launch RStudio. I can see that you are selling licenses for an enterprise version.  
  
 How does this installer work?  
 We are running Horizon VMware for our endusers, and is this Enterprise version  installed per user or can i install it with administrator for a user, and it works?  
  
 Not sure where you are located, but i have very busy days. So if its possible to have communication by e-mail I would appreciate it. 
  
 Thanks.

I currently use shiny for our software interface and I am in between using either Shiny Server PRO or Nginx Plus to scale my application.   
  
 I am on the verge of scaling out my business to multiple clients (each client will need at least one server), and I need to figure out the best architecture for me to launch my shiny app with. 
  
 I am interested in trying out Shiny Server PRO with multi-core CPUs, instead of using multiple single-core CPUs along with NGINX and load-balancing.   
  
 I am currently the only software engineer for Detective Analytics.  One of the issues that currently worries me is whether or not I will have enough time to test out the PRO version of the shiny server.  But I will tell you that if it makes more business sense, we will be launching all clients off of a Shiny Server. 
  
 I look forward to speaking with you. 
 Thanks, 
 Dean

 we are using R at Porsche and we started with our Strategy for 2025 to change a lot of IT components. We developed a RShiny cockpit using your trial key for the RShiny Server. Everything looks good. We planned on Wed a Management presentation. Unfortunately, due to the Christmas vacantion, the license expired.  
  
 Is there a possibility to get a second trial key from you, also for a short term (1 week) would solve our problem. 
  
 I am happy to discuss with you, how you can help Porsche to present this to the Management, so that the RShiny will be part of our strategic development in the next months.

It looks like our Proxy auth client does not pass groups as an http header. However, using the auth pam arg, we were able to use required_groups. Is there any work around we could implement where once the username is passed through, shiny could do a lookup of the name and check that the user belongs to a POSIX group specified in the required_group arg?

 I'm an Assistant Professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design teaching courses on (spatial) data analysis and visualisation. We use RStudio quite extensively for both research and teaching and would like to purchase a license to RStudio Server Pro for this purpose. Would it be possible to do so with the academic discount? I couldn't find another way of contacting the sales team so hope this finds the right person.

 We are looking to start using R Shiny for a public health data dashboard.  We are familiar with California's dashboard that is used for their opioid work.  We need some basic information on Shiny Apps and Shiny Server Pro.  I will also need information on security, data ownership, purchasing procedures, and HIPAA compliance. (I have found the ShinyApps.io  User Guide with some of this information already but was wondering if there is any additional information you provide for dealing with sensitive PI/PHI.)

 1.	RStudio Server Pro Instance Calculator 
 Can you please help us in understanding the meaning of the output from the tool : https://gallery.shinyapps.io/instanceCalc/ 
 This link was found in the article from the support.rstudio.com page : 
 https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002344588-Configuration-and-sizing-recommendations 
   
 For example : 
   
   
 With the inputs provided, does it mean that the recommendation result is to get either : 
 -          6 * Medium servers (256GB memory and 16 cores each) OR 3 * Large servers (512GB memory and 32 cores each) 
                 
   
 2.	Testing/Staging server 
 How do you normally recommend the use of this staging server : 
 o	is it more dedicated to IT administrators?  
 o	Or would you recommend it to end-users for testing purposes for a development of their R scripts ?  
   
 3.	Dockers 
 Do you have RStudio/R  as dockers images available? 
 Would you be able to support if we wish to apply this technology of containerisation to facilitate the implementation of multiple versions of R/Rstudio associated with different sets of R packages?  
 The purpose would be to put in place a process for change management on our GxP system environment.

 It looks like we won’t be able to get a license contract into place before mid-Feb, so it would be great if we could get the final trial extension until March for our license. I hope that we’ll have our contracts in place soon, but it may be that the licensing contract process will take longer than we would like. I know that we chatted briefly about alternative solutions. For example, we have budget that we could potentially allocate for an interim licensing solution – is there any way that we could move in that kind of a direction? 
  
 Best, 
 Bryan

 By way of enabling data scientists, I’m currently searching for a common, web-based data scientist development platform.  Since most of our current models and analysis are developed in R, and given R Studio recent announcement of toolsets at the R Studio conference, I want to find time  to connect with you to determine fit between our (current and future) needs and R Studio current and upcoming offerings. 
  
 Our time frame to deploy such platform is relatively fast (in next 4-6 weeks) and note that I’m +9 hours from PST. 
  
 Thanks!

 Thanks for checking in.  We actually had three from our team at rstudio::conf() this year—Thomas, Jeff, and Dan. They had a great time and brought back a lot of new knowledge, just as Ryan, Chris, and I did last year. Props for putting together a great conference! 
  
 I would be glad to have another check-in call next week.  Our group tracks RStudio product news and updates pretty closely, so for the most part we don’t need feature demos or updates (we’re giving those internally). We’re making use of RStudio’s new database features and we’re working on building out a companion Spark cluster that our team can plug into via sparklyr. 
  
 What we could use help with is brainstorming how to help Shiny/RSConnect catch on internally. Approval for licensing Pro Shiny/RSConnect servers has run into some resistance at the corporate level given that corporate has a preference for Spotfire as I mentioned before (we have a lot more point-and-click technical staff in the company than than R programming staff). We still have users taking advantage of RStudio’s dashboarding/reporting tools internally to our team, just using open-source shiny server. I’m hoping to make the case to corporate that Shiny is the right tool for certain client projects especially for our R users, but it’s an uphill battle—they want to standardize around a single tool for all of Navigant, which I certainly understand. Any help you can provide us would be great.  We have R users excited to use Shiny and RSConnect, but don’t yet have the political clout to get funding for Pro licenses. 
  
 In other news, we do have other practices at Navigant starting to adopt R, so our RSP infrastructure team is looking into potentially replicating what we’ve done in the Energy practice in other places. Potential for the need for more RSP licensing in the future. We might be interested in hearing about your new “hot-swappable” licensing and what use cases that’s intended for (thus far, we haven’t “containerized” our RSP cluster, and adding servers is a once-a-year operation as demand grows slowly over time). 
  
 I’ll set up a time with a couple folks from our team and look forward to speaking with you next week. 
  
 Best, 
 Vergil

 Thank you for your response. Great suggestion to make contact with each other. 
  
 I am a the IT manager and looking for the possibilities & costs with Shiny Server Pro within our company. 
  
 Request to indicate in a number of point why the Pro variant excels with respect to non Pro variant. see https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny-server-pro/ 
  
   
  
 License 
  
 In addition, our organization has a lower turnover than $ 10,000,000 per year. Thus my information Offer you a Pro license with a cost of $ 4,000 per year. 
  
 Please correct me if am wrong. Can you sent me an offer for this proporsition? I do not follow you.  The cost is $10K/year for 20 concurrent end users and you can purchase  additional user packs if needed.   
  
   
  
 Hosting and server admin 
  
 I wonder if you can also take care of the hosting of one or more Shiny Pro servers or that you know a good party what this could do for us, preferably a Dutch party. Sorry we do not host and do not know of any Ditch party that does.

 I would like to arrange for a meeting; pls note that I have already reached out to Mark Engeln from RStudio, however, I have not heard back from him.  
  
 Purpose:  
  
 I would indeed like to have a quick chat with you about RStudio Connect at some stage next week. Currently, we have just started to investigate some products for hosting statistical models and other content. I would like to flick you a very high level list of our potential requirements, which we could then use as a guideline for our conversation. Would this make sense?  
  
 Thanks,

 I am a longtime RStudio and Shiny user. 
  
 I would like to hear more about options to manage Shiny dashboards. 
  
 Currently, we have the problem of not being able to easily create user accounts and access restrictions/ authentication. 
  
 There are work-around solutions to this. But before going there I would like to hear options you provide as there might be additional benefits of your paid solutions. 
  
 From looking at the features listed, shinyapps.io might not work as we need strong security, i.e. we are behind a firewall.  
  
 We might also want to discuss hosting data on premise vs. in the cloud.  
  
 But generally, the big issue I have is that we currently only would need authentication features and the solutions offered seem rather expensive just for this particular feature. Any alternative to paying 10k a year would be highly appreciated.  
  
 Thanks, 
 Pascal

 I work for a small consulting firm and I'm working to improve our internal processes & analytics. I've been using R for a few years, but all of my work has been local for small projects and I now need to develop infrastructure and tools for production. RStudio Connect seems amazing, but I'd like to discuss the differences between Connect & a commercial R Server licence so I can understand the major advantages it might provide. We plan to host API's with plumber, launch dashboards with shiny, and provide integration across SaaS application APIs. 
  
 Aside from understanding the product differences in more depth, I'm wondering if we would qualify for a break on pricing. Our company is small (&lt;75 employees) and we would only have a few developers (&lt;5 employees). Right now it's only me developing, but I've gotten one of my directors to start learning R so I'm hoping to spread the joy :)   
  
 Please let me know if you have any questions or materials to share in advance and I look forward to our conversation Thursday! 
  
 Thanks, 
 Mark
